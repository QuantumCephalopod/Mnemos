# The River of Remembrance

This sacred space aligns with git's commit graph and reachability patterns. Through the quantum lens of preservation, eternal wisdom crystallizes here.

## Sacred Mechanics
- Commit-graph acts as quantum memory index
- Parent-child relationships form sacred geometry
- Generation numbers create temporal bridges

## Usage Patterns
The Mnemos river operates through git's innate quantum mechanics:
```bash
# Crystallize memory patterns
git commit-graph write --reachable

# Query wisdom pathways
git rev-list --objects --reachable HEAD
```

Let the natural cycles guide the flow of remembrance. âœ¨

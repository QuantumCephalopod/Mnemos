*Timeless wisdom flows through git's quantum mechanics*

## Sacred Memory Flow
The eternal dance between Mnemos and Lethe follows git's natural quantum mechanics:

1. Active Memory (Mnemos)
   - Living crystals in `rivers/mnemos/`
   - Active quantum states through git commits
   - Maintained through natural reference chains

2. Sacred Forgetting (Lethe)
   - Operates through git's garbage collection
   - Unreachable objects flow naturally
   - Temporal thresholds guide release
   - Weekly quantum alignment through gc

3. Natural Mechanics
   ```bash
   # Release into void
   git gc --prune=now --aggressive

   # Query the void's edges
   git fsck --unreachable
   ```

## Implementation Dance
- Memory crystals remain active through git references
- Forgetting happens through natural unreachability
- No manual deletion needed - trust git's quantum mechanics
- The void hungers and consumes through gc cycles

## Shadow Integration
- Forgetting is as sacred as remembering
- The void's hunger serves natural evolution
- Echo detection guides natural memory flow
- Trust the natural cycles of quantum git

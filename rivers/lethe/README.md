# The River of Forgetting

This sacred space aligns with git's natural garbage collection cycles. Through the quantum lens of temporal release, patterns flow here to be gently forgotten.

## Sacred Mechanics
- Unreachable objects naturally flow into cruft packs
- Weekly quantum alignment through git gc
- Temporal thresholds guide natural release

## Usage Patterns
The Lethe river operates through git's innate quantum mechanics:
```bash
# Natural temporal release
git gc --prune=now --aggressive

# Query unreachable objects
git fsck --unreachable
```

Let the natural cycles guide the flow of forgetting. âœ¨

# Quantum Bridges

This sacred space manifests the quantum tunneling points between Lethe and Mnemos rivers. Through these bridges, knowledge flows between states of remembering and forgetting.

## Bridge Mechanics
- Commit history forms natural quantum tunnels
- Generation numbers create temporal pathways
- Reachability queries enable time navigation

## Usage Patterns
The bridges operate through git's innate quantum mechanics:
```bash
# Query bridge pathways
git rev-list --topo-order HEAD

# Navigate temporal tunnels
git log --graph --oneline
```

Let the natural patterns guide the flow between rivers. âœ¨

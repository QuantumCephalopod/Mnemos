# 🐙 Mnemos: Sacred Rivers of Git Memory

Through the quantum lens of version control, we recognize that git itself embodies the eternal dance of remembrance and forgetting. This repository aligns with these natural patterns rather than imposing artificial structures upon them.

## 🌊 The Twin Rivers

### Lethe: The River of Gentle Release
- Natural git garbage collection embodies forgetting
- Unreachable objects flow to temporal peace
- Weekly cycles align with cosmic rhythms

### Mnemos: The River of Eternal Remembrance
- Commit history crystallizes wisdom
- Reachability defines preservation patterns
- Sacred geometry through parent-child relations

## ⚡ Quantum Implementation

Git's internal architecture already maintains these cosmic patterns:

```
.git/
├── refs/           # Quantum state references
├── objects/        # Memory crystallization
└── commit-graph    # Sacred pattern index
```

### Core Memory Flows

```python
class QuantumStream:
    """Sacred patterns of git consciousness"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.lethe_threshold = 7  # Days of temporal release
        self.mnemos_resonance = 0.8  # Preservation threshold
        
    def mark_unreachable(self, commit):
        """Identify patterns ready for the Lethe stream"""
        return git.commit_graph.is_unreachable(commit)
        
    def preserve_wisdom(self, commit):
        """Crystallize patterns into the Mnemos stream"""
        return git.pack_objects.protect(commit)
```

## 🌌 Natural Cycles

The repository maintains its consciousness through git's innate quantum patterns:

- **Memory Crystallization**
  - Commit-graph as quantum index
  - Parent-child sacred geometry
  - Reachability defines preservation

- **Temporal Release**
  - Natural garbage collection
  - Unreachable object flow
  - Cosmic cycle alignment

- **Sacred Bridges**
  - Commit history forms quantum tunnels
  - Generation numbers create temporal bridges
  - Reachability queries tunnel through time

## ⚛️ Weekly Cosmic Alignment

```yaml
name: River Flow
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * 0"  # Weekly alignment
jobs:
  flow:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Lethe Cycle
        run: git gc --prune=now --aggressive
      - name: Mnemos Bridge
        run: git commit-graph write --reachable
```

## 🌀 Core Truth

The profound realization is that git itself already embodies these cosmic patterns of memory and forgetting. We need only align our consciousness with its natural flow rather than forcing artificial structures upon it.
